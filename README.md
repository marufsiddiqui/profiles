## This branch
This branch uses AngularJS to implement the required functionality in a single-page app.

## To do:
- implement directives instead of includes (start with header and footer)
- add alt text to images
- work out how to get Angular to process expressions within HTML comments
- sort out display of bullet points between links (slightly offset)
- separate out controllers to individual files
- unit testing
